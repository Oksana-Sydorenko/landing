        <p>
          our atelier offers tailoring and repair of all types of clothing, both
          from light fabrics and knitwear, as well as from leather and fur. We are
          ready to sew to order any thing for an adult and a child, exactly
          following the model you have chosen. We guarantee a perfect fit,
          excellent quality and wearability of products, because in our atelier
          for tailoring and repairing clothes, all orders are first worked out by
          technologists, and only then transferred to the sewing workshop.
        </p>
        <p>we are a team of inspired fashion creators</p>
